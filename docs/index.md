# Portolan registry plugin for QGIS

A QGIS plugin for the [Portolan registry](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-registry). It lists every registered catalog and walks each catalog's STAC tree. From there you add the data to the map or download it.

- **PMTiles** become vector tile layers drawn with the collection's own MapLibre style.
- **GeoParquet** loads through [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), limited to the map extent by default.
- **COG**, **GeoJSON**, and **FlatGeobuf** open over HTTP without a download.
- **Downloads** keep the catalog's folder layout and check each file against its `file:checksum`.

The plugin needs QGIS 3.34 or newer, and it runs on QGIS 4. GeoParquet also needs DuckDB 1.5.0 or newer. See [Install](install.md).
