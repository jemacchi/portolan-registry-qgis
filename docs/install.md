# Install

The plugin is not in the official QGIS plugin repository yet. Install it from a release zip or from a clone.

## From a release

Download the zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-registry-qgis/releases). In QGIS, open **Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Install from ZIP** and pick the file.

## From a clone

Link the package folder into your QGIS profile, then enable **Portolan Registry** in the plugin manager.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-registry-qgis
PLUGINS=~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins
ln -s "$PWD/portolan-registry-qgis/portolan_registry_qgis" \
  "$PLUGINS/portolan_registry_qgis"
```

A Flatpak QGIS keeps its profile under `~/.var/app/org.qgis.qgis/data/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins`.

## DuckDB for GeoParquet

QGIS does not include DuckDB. The plugin works without it, and asks for it the first time you add a GeoParquet asset.

Install it with the Python that QGIS uses, then restart QGIS. On Linux with a system QGIS:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user 'duckdb>=1.5.0'
```

With the Flatpak QGIS, the Python inside the sandbox is read-only, so install into your user folder:

```bash
flatpak run --command=python3 org.qgis.qgis \
  -m pip install --user 'duckdb>=1.5.0'
```

On Windows and macOS, run this in the QGIS Python console:

```python
import subprocess, sys
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "duckdb>=1.5.0"])
```

DuckDB downloads its `httpfs` and `spatial` extensions on first use.
